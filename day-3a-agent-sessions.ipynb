Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.

You've learned the fundamentals of building stateful AI agents:\n\n- ✅ **Context Engineering** - You understand how to assemble context for LLMs using Context Compaction\n- ✅ **Sessions & Events** - You can maintain conversation history across multiple turns\n- ✅ **Persistent Storage** - You know how to make conversations survive restarts\n- ✅ **Session State** - You can track structured data during conversations\n- ✅ **Manual State Management** - You've experienced both the power and limitations of manual approaches\n- ✅ **Production Considerations** - You're ready to handle real-world challenges\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## ✅ Congratulations! You did it 🎉\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only. You **do not** need to submit it anywhere to complete the course.\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\nRefer to the following documentation to learn more:\n\n- [ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- [ADK Sessions](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- [ADK Session-State](https://medium.com/google-cloud/2-minute-adk-manage-context-efficiently-with-artifacts-6fcc6683d274)\n- [ADK Session Compaction](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/#define-compactor)\n\n### 🎯 Next Steps - Long Term Memory Systems (Part 2)\n\n#### Why do we need memory?\nIn this notebook, we manually identified a couple characteristic (username and country) and built tools to manage it. But real conversations involve hundreds of such characteristics:\n- User preferences and habits\n- Past interactions and their outcomes\n- Domain knowledge and expertise levels\n- Communication styles and patterns\n- Contextual relationships between topics\n\n**The Memory System in ADK automates this entire process**, making it a valuable asset for building truly Context-Aware Agents that can accommodate any user's current and future needs.\n\nIn the next notebook (Part 2: Memory Management), you'll learn how to:\n- Enable automatic memory extraction from conversations\n- Build agents that learn and adapt over time\n- Create truly personalized experiences at scale\n- Manage long-term knowledge across sessions\n\nReady to transform your manual state management into an intelligent, automated Memory system? Let's continue to Part 2!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n| Authors |\n| --- |\n| [Sampath M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/msampathkumar/) |","metadata":{}}]}
