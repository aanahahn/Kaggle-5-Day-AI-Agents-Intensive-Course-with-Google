    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

      "At its core, a MAS is a collection of \"agents\" – independent entities capable of perception, reasoning, and action. These agents don't just run pre-programmed scripts; they collaborate. This inherent ability to coordinate allows them to tackle complex problems far beyond the scope of a single program.\n",

Their decentralized nature offers inherent fault tolerance, meaning a failure in one agent doesn't bring down the entire system.

Plus, scaling becomes a breeze – simply add or remove agents as needed, ensuring efficient resource management for fluctuating workloads.\n",

    "The previous sequential agent is great, but it's an assembly line. Each step must wait for the previous one to finish. What if you have several tasks that are **not dependent** on each other? For example, researching three *different* topics. Running them in sequence would be slow and inefficient, creating a bottleneck where each task waits unnecessarily.\n",

Once all parallel tasks are complete, you can then pass their combined results to a final 'aggregator' step.\n",

For thirty years, the lighthouse had been his world, its steady beam a comforting pulse against the inky sea. Tonight, however, the rhythm felt off. A strange shimmer, not from the lamp, caught his eye on the dusty table in his quarters. It was a map, rolled and tied with a faded crimson ribbon, unlike any he’d ever seen.\n",

Elias, a man who thought he knew every secret of the sea, felt a prickle of both fear and exhilaration. The ocean, it seemed, still held wonders.\n",
      "CriticAgent > The story is concise and effectively sets up a mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Show, Don't Just Tell, Elias's Personality:** While we're told Elias has been a lighthouse keeper for thirty years and thought he knew the sea's secrets, we don't see much of his personality beyond that. Consider adding a small detail or action that reveals more about him before the map appears – perhaps he hums a familiar sea shanty, or his movements are precise and methodical, reflecting his long tenure. This will make his reaction to the extraordinary map more impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Heighten the Sensory Experience of the Map:** The description of the map is good with the glowing constellations and luminescent islands. To make it even more evocative, consider adding other sensory details. Does the map emit a faint sound? Does it feel unusually warm or cool to the touch? Does it have a scent, perhaps of ozone or an unknown spice? Adding more senses will make the discovery feel more tangible.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Foreshadow the \"Off Rhythm\":** The sentence \"Tonight, however, the rhythm felt off\" is a good hook, but it's a bit abstract. You could strengthen this by hinting at what Elias *perceives* as being off. Is the light from the lamp flickering slightly? Is the foghorn sounding at an unusual interval? Or is it more of an internal feeling, a prickling on his skin that he can't explain? Making this initial unease more concrete will ground the magical discovery that follows.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias methodically polished the brass railing, his movements as familiar and ingrained as the tides. For thirty years, this lighthouse had been his solitary world, its steady beam a comforting pulse against the inky sea. Tonight, however, the rhythmic sweep of the light seemed hesitant, almost uncertain, and a low, discordant hum vibrated through the tower's stone – a subtle disruption in the ocean's lullaby that made the hairs on his arm prickle. A strange shimmer, not from the lamp, caught his eye on the dusty table in his cramped quarters. It was a map, rolled and tied with a faded crimson ribbon, unlike any he’d ever seen.\n",
